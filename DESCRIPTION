Description: An interface to the 'mclust' package to easily carry out latent profile
    analysis ("LPA"). Provides functionality to estimate commonly-specified models.
    Follows a tidy approach, in that output is in the form of a data frame that can
    subsequently be computed on. Also has functions to interface to the commercial 
    'MPlus' software via the 'MplusAutomation' package.
