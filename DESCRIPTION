Description: Easily carry out latent profile analysis ("LPA"), determine the
    correct number of classes based on best practices, and tabulate and plot the
    results. Provides functionality to estimate commonly-specified models with
    free means, variances, and covariances for each profile. Follows a tidy
    approach, in that output is in the form of a data frame that can
    subsequently be computed on. Models can be estimated using the free open
    source 'R' packages 'Mclust' and 'OpenMx', or using the commercial program
    'MPlus', via the 'MplusAutomation' package.
