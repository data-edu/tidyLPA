Description: An interface to the 'mclust' package to easily
    carry out latent profile analysis ("LPA"). Provides functionality to
    estimate commonly-specified models.  Follows a tidy approach, in that
    output is in the form of a data frame that can subsequently be
    computed on. Also has functions to interface to the commercial 'MPlus'
    software via the 'MplusAutomation' package.
